To remove/restore data click on a plot and draw a square, then use one of the key combinations listed.

In DATA PROFILE and PSEUDOSECTION:
• Alt+Q    remove the selected measurements;
• Alt+A    restore the selected measurements;

In DECAYS and DATA STRIPE:
• Alt+Q    remove the selected gates;
• Alt+A    restore the selected gates;
• Alt+W    remove from the first gate in the plot to the last gate selected, for the decays in which there is a selection;
• Alt+S    restore from the first gate in the plot to the last gate selected, for the decays in which there is a selection;
• Alt+E    remove from the first selected gate to the last gate in the plot, for the decays in which there is a selection;
• Alt+D    restore from the first selected gate to the last gate in the plot, for the decays in which there is a selection;
• Alt+N    remove the selected gates, if negative;
• Alt+M    restore the selected gates, if positive;
• Shift+Q  remove all the gates from the decays in which there is a selection;
• Shift+A  restore all the gates from the decays in which there is a selection;
• Shift+N  remove all the negative gates from the decays in which there is a selection;
• Shift+M  restore all the positive gates from the decays in which there is a selection.

Additionally, only in DATA STRIPE and PATCHWORK:
• Ctrl+Q   remove all the gates selected from all the decays of the set;
• Ctrl+A   restore all the gates selected from all the decays of the set;
• Ctrl+N   remove all the gates selected from all the decays of the set, if negative;
• Ctrl+M   restore all the gates selected from all the decays of the set, if positive.

Without the selection needed and for all the plots:
• Ctrl+Z   ‘undo’, to reverse the last action (maximum 10 times);
• Ctrl+Y   ‘redo’, to reverse the last ‘undo’ action (maximum 10 times).
